        "content": "<h2>Introduction to React Hooks</h2><p>React Hooks are a powerful feature that allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Introduced in React 16.8, they enable function components to have their own state and lifecycle methods. This can significantly simplify your code and make it easier to reuse logic across components.</p><p><strong>Basic Hooks:</strong> React provides several built-in hooks like <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. The <code>useState</code> hook allows you to add state to functional components, while <code>useEffect</code> lets you perform side effects in function components.</p><ul><li><em>useState</em> - Manages state in functional components.</li><li><em>useEffect</em> - Handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions.</li></ul><p>With hooks, you can write cleaner and more manageable code, avoiding the complexity of class components. For more advanced use cases, custom hooks can be created to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.</p>",

        "content": "<h2>Redux for State Management</h2><p>Redux is a popular state management library for JavaScript applications, particularly with React. It provides a predictable way to manage application state using actions, reducers, and a central store. This allows for easier debugging and better state management across your application.</p><p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong> Redux revolves around three core principles:</p><ol><li><strong>Single Source of Truth:</strong> The state of your application is stored in a single store.</li><li><strong>State is Read-Only:</strong> The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions.</li><li><strong>Changes are Made with Pure Functions:</strong> Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.</li></ol><p>By following these principles, Redux helps you manage state in a more organized and predictable manner. Integrating Redux with React can be achieved using the <code>react-redux</code> library, which provides bindings to connect React components to the Redux store.</p>",
